Play 2.1 application
=====================================

Please run using Play Framework 2.1.5 with the following command: 
play run

The application then runs on http://localhost:9000

Because I am using an in memory database the first time a user
browses to the app they will have to allow Play to evolve the database
by running the setup scripts. The page will have a message in the 
header with a button that needs to be clicked:

***********
Database 'default' needs evolution!
An SQL script will be run on your database - [Apply this script now!]
***********
