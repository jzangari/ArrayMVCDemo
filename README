Play 2.1 application
=====================================

Please run using Play Framework 2.15 or higher by running: 
play run

The application then runs on http://localhost:9000

Because I am using an in memory database the first time you
browse browse you will have to allow Play to "evolve" the database
by running the setup scripts. The page will have a message in the 
header with a button:

***********
Database 'default' needs evolution!
An SQL script will be run on your database - [Apply this script now!]
***********
